traithull
=========

Provides an interface to the Qhull program that allows ecologists to easily calculate the convex hull volume (CHV) metric of functional diversity and do tests against null models. For a description of the method see: Cornwell, W.K, D.W. Schwilk and D.D. Ackerly. 2006. A trait-based test for habitat filtering: convex hull volume. Ecology 87: 1465--1471.
